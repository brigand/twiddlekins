Twiddlekins is a chat bot that works on the IRC protocal.  It responds to certain keywords by finding information for the users.

This branch is for the major task of moving the hard coded trigger handling (mostly) to a plain text file in an INI format.  It requires rewriting multiple files and adding a few new ones to parse the .conf file.

This is a temporary README file.  It will be updated later.
